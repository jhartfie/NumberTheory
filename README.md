# **NumberTheory**

This repository contains a collection of Python programs that explore various concepts in number theory. These programs demonstrate both fundamental and advanced number theory topics, providing implementations and examples for each.

## **Programs Included**

1. **CarmichaelNumbers.py**
   - **Description**: Finds all Carmichael numbers up to a specified limit. Carmichael numbers are composite numbers that satisfy Fermat's little theorem for all integers that are coprime to the number.
   
2. **ContinuedFractionsAndDioPhantineApproximations.py**
   - **Description**: Implements continued fractions and explores Diophantine approximations, which are used to find the best rational approximations of real numbers.
   
3. **EulersTotientFunction.py**
   - **Description**: Calculates Euler's Totient function, which counts the number of integers up to a given integer \( n \) that are coprime with \( n \).
   
4. **FermatNumbers.py**
   - **Description**: Generates Fermat numbers, which are numbers of the form \( 2^{2^n} + 1 \). The program checks which of these numbers are prime.
   
5. **GoldbachsConjecture.py**
   - **Description**: Tests Goldbach's conjecture for even numbers up to a specified limit. Goldbach's conjecture states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.
   
6. **HappyNumbers.py**
   - **Description**: Finds all happy numbers within a given range. A happy number is a number that eventually reaches 1 when replaced by the sum of the square of each digit.
   
7. **KaprekarNumbers.py**
   - **Description**: Identifies Kaprekar numbers within a given range. A Kaprekar number is one where the square of the number can be split into two parts that sum to the original number.
   
8. **LagrangesFourSquareTheorem.py**
   - **Description**: Implements Lagrange's Four Square Theorem, which states that every natural number can be represented as the sum of four integer squares.
   
9. **MersennePrimes.py**
   - **Description**: Generates Mersenne primes, which are primes of the form \( 2^p - 1 \) where \( p \) is also a prime number.
   
10. **PerfectNumbers.py**
    - **Description**: Finds all perfect numbers up to a specified limit. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors.
    
11. **RamanujanPartitionFunction.py**
    - **Description**: Computes the partition function, which gives the number of distinct ways of representing an integer as the sum of positive integers.
    
12. **SophieGermainPrimes.py**
    - **Description**: Identifies Sophie Germain primes, which are primes \( p \) such that \( 2p + 1 \) is also prime.
    
13. **TaxiCabNumbers.py**
    - **Description**: Finds Taxicab numbers, which are numbers that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in more than one way.
    
14. **TwinPrimes.py**
    - **Description**: Finds all twin primes within a specified range. Twin primes are pairs of primes that differ by 2.
